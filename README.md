# DO YOU KNOW ME - CLI Quiz App

This is a simple CLI app made with nodeJs and is hosted on replit.com

LOGIC:
I have created a array of objects that stores the the information abpout each question, i.e the question and its answer in form of key and value pairs. The objects are called one by one using a 'for loop'. When the player chooses one of the three given options, 'if-else condition' is used to check if the answer is correct. If it is correct then the score is increased. This score is displayed at the end.

LIBRARIES USED:

  1. readline-sync --> used to read the input.
  2. CHALK --> For adding colours.
